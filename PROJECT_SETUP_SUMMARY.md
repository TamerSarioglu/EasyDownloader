# Project Setup Summary

## Task 1: Set up project structure and dependencies - COMPLETED ✅

### ✅ Create new Android project with Jetpack Compose
- Project already existed with basic Jetpack Compose setup
- Updated MainActivity to use Hilt and improved UI

### ✅ Configure build.gradle files with all required dependencies
- **Updated gradle/libs.versions.toml** with all required versions:
  - Hilt 2.51.1
  - Retrofit 2.11.0 with Kotlinx Serialization
  - Navigation Compose 2.8.4
  - DataStore 1.1.1
  - OkHttp 4.12.0
  - Coroutines 1.9.0
  - KSP 2.0.21-1.0.28

- **Updated app/build.gradle.kts** with all dependencies:
  - Hilt for dependency injection
  - Retrofit + OkHttp for networking
  - Kotlinx Serialization for JSON parsing
  - Navigation Compose for navigation
  - DataStore for secure storage
  - ViewModel Compose integration
  - All testing dependencies

### ✅ Set up KSP for annotation processing
- Added KSP plugin to build configuration
- KSP is working correctly (verified by generated files in build/generated/ksp/)
- Hilt annotation processing working (verified by generated Hilt components)

### ✅ Configure proguard rules for release builds
- Updated proguard-rules.pro with comprehensive rules for:
  - Retrofit and OkHttp
  - Kotlinx Serialization
  - Hilt
  - Compose
  - Network connectivity handling
- Enabled minification and resource shrinking for release builds
- Added debug build variant with proper configuration

### ✅ Project Structure Created
Created Clean Architecture directory structure:
```
app/src/main/java/com/tamersarioglu/easydownloader/
├── data/
│   ├── local/
│   ├── remote/
│   │   ├── api/
│   │   └── dto/
│   └── repository/
├── domain/
│   ├── model/
│   ├── repository/
│   └── usecase/
├── presentation/
│   ├── auth/
│   ├── navigation/
│   ├── video_list/
│   └── video_submission/
└── di/
```

### ✅ Application Class and Manifest Configuration
- Created EasyDownloaderApplication class with @HiltAndroidApp
- Updated AndroidManifest.xml to reference the Application class
- Added INTERNET permission for network requests

### ✅ Build Verification
- ✅ Debug build successful (1m 32s)
- ✅ Release build successful (5m 3s) with minification
- ✅ APK files generated successfully
- ✅ Hilt components generated correctly
- ✅ KSP annotation processing working
- ✅ All dependencies resolved without conflicts

## Requirements Coverage
This task addresses the following requirements:
- **1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1, 6.1, 7.1**: Basic project structure and foundation for all features
- All core dependencies needed for authentication, video submission, networking, and UI are now configured

## Next Steps
The project is now ready for implementing the core functionality:
1. Data layer implementation (DTOs, API service, repository)
2. Domain layer (models, use cases)
3. Presentation layer (ViewModels, UI screens)
4. Dependency injection modules
